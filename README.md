# ES6-DEMO

This demo contains a simple canvas game implemented in ES6.

Some parts have deliberately not been converted to ES6 and are left as an exercise for the participants to identify and fix.

---

A gulp task has already been configured to transpile the source to ES5 code.
Please follow the below steps to get started.

- Install gulp globally.

```bash
sudo npm install -g gulp
```

- Navigate to the root folder and type in npm install to install local dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

- Now type in gulp to transpile the ES6 code into ES5 and generate a bundle file.

```bash
gulp
```

- Your game is all set. Open the index.html in a browser to see the demo.
